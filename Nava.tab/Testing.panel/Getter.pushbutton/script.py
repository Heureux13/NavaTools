Description:

Current goal fucntion of button is: return total weight including insulation.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
This button is for testin code snippets and ideas before implementing them.
Odds are it will be constantly changing and not useful, its entire purpose
is for the author to have a quick button to test whatever code they are working on.
If you press it could do nothing, throw an error, or change something in your model.
Once working, it will most likely be moved to a more permanent location.
